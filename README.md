# BopNet The new generation BopBot

BopNet music bot is a new and simple Youtube music streaming bot for Discord using NetCord.

This Bot differs from my previous Music Bot (BopBot) attempts by using C# and requiring no other major frameworks to run.

# Requirements
Due to it being a music bot the system which will run the Bot needs FFMPEG and YT-DLP installed on it

appsettings.json requires a Discord Token which can be gotten from Discord Developer Portal.

See Netcords excellent guide on how to get a token https://netcord.dev/guides/getting-started/making-a-bot.html?tabs=generic-host

# How to use?

Once the bot starts up an invitation link will be shown which will allow the bot to be added to a Discord server.
